# Sdl

The main purpose of this SPA is to provide manual data logging with the help of MEAN stack using CRUD operations
and a custom API (https://github com/isostarec/sdl-api). Type of data logged using this app is of various SQL syntax-like type
including operations such as but not limited to: Table insertions, procedure insertions, etc. This data is logged so changes accross multiple, unrelated clones of the same db are synced. This could be done following many reasons, one of which is that the app deployed to multiple versions of the same db strucutre can encounter bugs if dbs are not in sync.

TLDR; Keep log of db changes so you can sync changes accross multiple dbs.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
